ChatBot based on the LLAMA 3.2-3B-Instruct Model which take as input a pdf file of low dimension, analyze it and make thoughtful conversation about it. 
You can talk about the pdf content, ask questions and explanation of something you didn't understand properly. As it is implemented locally, answers will take sometime to show
because the LLAMA ChatBot is going to use most of the resources of your PC, so be sure to have quite good CPU, GPU and RAM (minimum 16 GB).
